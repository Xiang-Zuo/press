/**
 * @uniweb/press/latex — React builder components for LaTeX documents.
 *
 * The data-* attribute vocabulary is identical to the Typst builders
 * (paragraph, heading, list, blockQuote, image, table, chapterOpener,
 * codeBlock, asterism, raw, sequence, text, link). Both adapters walk
 * the same HTML-IR; the difference is downstream — typst.js emits
 * `*bold*` and `\=`-style headings, latex.js emits `\textbf{...}` and
 * `\section{...}`.
 *
 * Per `docs/architecture/adding-a-format.md` §"Worked example: LaTeX",
 * builders that share an attribute set with another HTML-based adapter
 * can be thin re-exports rather than parallel implementations. We
 * follow that here. Foundations writing JSX import from
 * `@uniweb/press/latex`; the same JSX produces a LaTeX bundle when
 * `compile('latex')` runs.
 *
 * The format adapter (compileLatex, buildBundle) lives at
 * src/adapters/latex.js and is intentionally NOT part of this barrel —
 * adapters are reached only via the dynamic-import inside
 * useDocumentCompile, so importing from '@uniweb/press/latex' does not
 * pull in the adapter or its ZIP helper.
